It's the final test of your Postman skills.\n\n1. **Validate your solutions locally**: You should have been checking your solutions locally for every challenge. If you haven't done that already, run through those validations now since your pull request will not be accepted with any errors.\n2. **Submit your information**: In this collection `Day 30: Submit for badge`, run the request `submit` and follow the instructions.\n    \n\n**Need help?** If you have a question related to the administration of this badge (e.g. not a technical Postman question), you can ask for guidance in the [Training](https://community.postman.com/c/training/38) section of the community forum.\n\nOnce your validations pass, you will receive a **30 day challenge** badge to proudly display on your social media profiles.",
